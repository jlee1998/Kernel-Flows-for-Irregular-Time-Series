# Kernel Flows for Irregular Time Series

Adapting the kernel flows algorithm so that it works when the points in the training data are sampled at irregular intervals, with a focus on attractor reconstruction of chaotic dynamical systems, including the Lorenz system and Henon map. See the attached Overleafs file (adapted from my master's research project report) for a description of the kernel flows algorithm and possible solutions to the problem of missing data.
